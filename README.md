# Sus-Bot
The sus bot discord bot that connects to tinder API and twitter
as well as other stuff. Named after my discord server, that was created in highschool so.

Most code is within [cogs](cogs) file 
- main files are: 
  - [redit](cogs/redit.py)
  - [casino](cogs/casino.py)
  - [tinder](cogs/tinder.py)
  
Each cog is a different file and a different class. They are discords way of grouping things.

Things other then [SusBot.py](SusBot.py) have been converted to a cog format but have not been deleted, but they are unused,
